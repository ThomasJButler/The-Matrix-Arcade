### 2. **Mid-Chapter Puzzle Trigger System**

**New Type Definition**:
```typescript
type PuzzleTrigger = {
  afterIndex: number;  // Trigger puzzle after this paragraph index
  puzzleId: string;
};

type StoryNode = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string[];
  ascii?: string[];
  puzzleTriggers?: PuzzleTrigger[];  // NEW!
};
```

**Implementation in `typeNextCharacter()`**:
```typescript
// Check for mid-chapter puzzle triggers
const node = STORY[currentNode];
const shouldTriggerPuzzle = node.puzzleTriggers?.find(
  trigger => trigger.afterIndex === currentTextIndex &&
             !gameState.state.completedPuzzles.includes(trigger.puzzleId)
);

if (shouldTriggerPuzzle) {
  // Trigger mid-chapter puzzle
  setTimeout(() => {
    setCurrentPuzzleId(shouldTriggerPuzzle.puzzleId);
    setShowPuzzle(true);
    setIsPaused(true);
  }, 2000);
}
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Triggers at specific paragraph indices
- ✅ Skips already-completed puzzles
- ✅ Pauses story during puzzle
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing system

---

### 3. **Fixed Resume Logic**

**Problem**: After completing a puzzle, game always jumped to next chapter

**Solution**: Smart resume logic that continues in current chapter
```typescript
// Resume story at next paragraph
setTimeout(() => {
  const node = STORY[currentNode];

  // Check if there are more paragraphs in current chapter
  if (currentTextIndex < node.content.length - 1) {
    // Continue to next paragraph in current chapter
    setCurrentTextIndex(prev => prev + 1);
    setCurrentCharIndex(0);
    setIsTyping(true);
    setUserHasScrolled(false);
  } else if (currentNode < STORY.length - 1) {
    // Current chapter complete, move to next chapter
    setDisplayedTexts([]);
    setCurrentNode(prev => prev + 1);
    // ...
  }
}, 500);
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Story flow feels natural
- ✅ No jarring chapter jumps
- ✅ Player stays immersed in current scene
