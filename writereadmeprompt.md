## Prompt 2: Write README
```
Write a README for this project following these rules:

1. NO emojis anywhere
2. UK English spelling throughout
3. Brief, practical sections - get to the point
4. Structure: What it is, Installation, Usage, Tech Stack, Key Features (if relevant)
5. Write like you're explaining to a colleague, not selling a product
6. No marketing speak or buzzwords
7. Code examples should be realistic, not foo/bar
8. Skip obvious sections (don't need "Prerequisites: Node.js" for a React app)
9. Include actual useful information: environment variables, common issues, deployment notes
10. One-line description at the top, then straight into it

Sound professional but genuine. Like Tom wrote it at 4pm on a Friday - clear but not overthinking it.
