Fix all code comments in this project following these rules:

1. Remove ALL emojis from comments
2. Use UK English spelling (optimised not optimized, colour not color, etc.)
3. Remove generic AI phrases: "enhanced", "refactored", "improved", "leverages", "robust", "streamlined"
4. Add JSDoc to all public functions with proper @param and @return types
5. Mark React useEffects with either /** @constructs **/ (runs once) or /** @listens dependency **/
6. Keep comments professional but genuine - explain WHY not WHAT
7. Add file headers: /** @author Tom Butler @date YYYY-MM-DD @description [what this file does] **/
8. Number complex logic steps (Heuristic 1, Heuristic 2, etc.)
9. TODOs must have context: // TODO [Tom]: Task description by deadline
10. Delete obvious comments that just restate the code

Sound like a real developer wrote this, not ChatGPT. Professional but human.
