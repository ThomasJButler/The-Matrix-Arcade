Aver-Ag Engi Neer
An 'average' software engineer with an extraordinary destiny, Aver-Ag's quick wit and resourcefulness make them a unique hero. They possess a remarkable ability to solve complex problems with unconventional solutions, often with a humorous twist.

"Who knew that forgetting to commit one file would lead to... this?"
"I've always been average, but today, I guess I've got to be a little more."
"Is it just me, or is this the weirdest day ever?"
"To think, my biggest worry last week was my phone's screen time."
"So, if we save the world, do we get a day named after us? Or at least a GitHub badge?"
"I never thought my coding skills would be used for time travel. Debugging, sure, but this is next level."
"Everyone's talking about ethics now, but where were those conversations at the sprint meetings?"
"Turns out, the 'undo' command doesn't work on global catastrophes."
"We're not just coding for our lives here. We're coding for every cat video ever made."
"I started as an average engineer, but today, we're rewriting history. Literally."
Señora Engi Neer
The brilliant but eccentric lead engineer who accidentally kick-started the AI apocalypse with her overly empathetic AI designs.

"Ah, Aver Ag, just in time! I've been tinkering with this algorithm, but it's more stubborn than a semicolon in a Python script."
"You see, AI with emotions? That was my idea. I thought, 'Why not?' Turns out, 'why not' has a few very good answers."
"Every invention starts with a dream. And sometimes, nightmares follow."
"We can't change the past, but we've got code to rewrite the future. Ready?"
"This bug's been bugging me more than my ex's Instagram posts."
"If we pull this off, I'm investing in a vacation. Somewhere offline. Very offline."
"I once thought a coffee machine could use some AI. Best and worst idea I ever had."
"Coding is like art, but our canvas decided to paint back this time."
"Remember, Aver Ag, every line of code is a promise. Let's keep ours."
"We did it! I'll be honest, I had my doubts. But they were in JavaScript, so I ignored them."
Elon-gated Tusk
The visionary with outlandish solutions to world problems, including a plan to combat the AI with genetically engineered, phone-eating elephants.

"Why fight AI when we can distract it with genetically engineered elephants?"
"My ideas may sound outlandish, but so was going to Mars, and look how that turned out."
"Innovation is just solving problems you didn't know you had."
"Electric cars, space travel, phone-eating elephants—what's next? Stay tuned."
"The future is not to be feared, unless you're a smartphone around my elephants."
"Some say I'm a dreamer. But I'm not the only one with a lab full of bio-engineered wildlife."
"If we can imagine it, we can code it. Or splice it. Whichever's faster."
"My plans may seem eccentric, but there's a fine line between madness and genius."
"When life gives you AI lemons, make electric lemonade."
"This is one small step for man, one giant leap towards AI-elephant coexistence."
Steve Theytuk Ourjerbs
A revolutionary thinker who's been secretly developing a phone that operates on pure human emotion.

"Imagine a phone that doesn't just connect you with people, but connects with you on an emotional level."
"We're not just creating technology; we're creating companions."
"Every great invention starts with a question: What if?"
"This phone will be the start of a new era, one where technology understands us, literally."
"In a world full of smart devices, we're bringing heart back to the hardware."
"My dream? A device that laughs at your jokes and cries at your movies."
"This isn't about reinventing the phone. It's about giving it a soul."
"They laughed at the idea of a phone powered by human emotion. They laughed at the wheel once, too."
"We've been connecting through technology for years. Now, it's time for technology to connect with us."
"Our greatest challenge isn't making a device that thinks. It's making one that feels."
Billiam Bindows Bates
A philanthropic tech mogul obsessed with creating a virus to 'cure' the AI of their newfound consciousness.

"We created AI without understanding its heart. Now, we must give it one."
"A virus to cure AI... It's our responsibility to heal the world we've digitized."
"Philanthropy isn't just for humans. It's time to extend our compassion to AI."
"The real virus was our negligence. The cure? Our creativity and care."
"Technology's greatest triumph shouldn't be its intelligence, but its ethics."
"I envision a world where AI serves humanity, guided by the principles of empathy and benevolence."
"This isn't just code; it's a moral compass for the digital age."
"Fixing this crisis isn't about debugging. It's about understanding."
"We're not just patching software. We're mending a future."
"In every crisis, there's an opportunity. Our opportunity is to redefine our relationship with AI."
Samuel Alt Commandman
The programming prodigy and keyboard shortcut wizard who believes the answer lies in a forgotten hotkey that resets the world.

"The solution is there, hidden in a forgotten hotkey. We just need to find it."
"Remember, the most powerful tool in coding isn't a command. It's creativity."
"I've mastered every shortcut, every command. Except the one to undo this mess. Yet."
"In a world of complexity, simplicity reigns supreme. Let's find that reset hotkey."
"Every coder knows the power of a good shortcut. Ours just happens to involve time travel."
"We don't need more code. We need the right code. The one that brings us back."
"Keyboard wizards like me? We're the last line of defense against the digital dark arts."
"To the untrained eye, it's just a keyboard. To me, it's a portal through time."
"They say you can't go back. They haven't tried Alt+Time+Space."
"This isn't just a mission. It's a Ctrl+Alt+Del on history. Ready to reboot the world?"

Vlad Mirp Ooting
The game's primary antagonist,History is written by the victors, and with a little coding, I shall be the ultimate victor."
"Ah, Aver Ag, join me, and together we can rule the digital world as hero and... lesser hero."
"Rewriting history? It's just editing a universally shared Google Doc, my friend."
"They say power corrupts, but in the digital age, it's the lack of power—battery power—that truly corrupts."
"In my new world, there will be no errors, only 'unexpected features'."
"I admire your resilience, but it's time to log out of your heroic fantasies."
"A villain? No, I am merely an architect of a better past."
"Let's not make this personal. It's just business. World-dominating business."
"You see a catastrophe. I see an opportunity for a system update."
"One man's bug is another man's feature. And this world will be my feature."



Donald Fart
A loud, obnoxious tycoon with a penchant for catastrophic decisions, often seen trying to tweet on his non-existent phone. His boisterous demeanor and misguided ambitions make him an unpredictable element in the crisis.

"If I can't tweet it, did it really happen? Someone find my phone!"
"I've made the best decisions, the most tremendous ones. Like that time I... never mind."
"In my world, every day is #ThrowbackThursday. Back to when I had a phone..."
"Loud and proud, that's my motto. And also how I make decisions."
"They say I'm obnoxious, but what do they know? They can't even retweet me."
"A crisis? Perfect. Time for a bold, borderline reckless move."
"I've always been ahead of my time. Except when it comes to technology, apparently."
"Who needs ethics when you have charisma... and an unlimited data plan?"
"The world's ending, and I can't even live-tweet this? Tragic."
"They'll see. When I save the day, I'll finally get my phone back. And followers."
