  - Visual effects (cursor animation)
  - Performance with rapid input
  - Resource cleanup

## Testing Infrastructure

### Setup Files
- **vitest.config.ts**: Configured with React plugin, jsdom environment, and proper aliases
- **src/test/setup.ts**: 
  - Canvas API mocking with comprehensive 2D context
  - AudioContext mocking
  - matchMedia mocking
  - Automatic cleanup after each test

### Mocking Strategy
1. **Canvas API**: Complete 2D rendering context mock with all drawing methods
2. **AudioContext**: Full audio API mocking including oscillators, gain nodes, filters, and delay nodes
3. **RequestAnimationFrame**: Controlled animation frame triggering for testing game loops
4. **LocalStorage**: Mocked for testing save/load functionality
5. **Framer Motion**: Simplified mocks for animation components

## Test Patterns Used

### 1. **Game Loop Testing**
```typescript
let gameLoopCallback: (() => void) | null = null;
const advanceGameTick = () => {
  if (gameLoopCallback) {
    act(() => gameLoopCallback!());
  }
};
```

### 2. **Canvas Testing**
```typescript
expect(HTMLCanvasElement.prototype.getContext).toHaveBeenCalled();
```

### 3. **Async State Updates**
```typescript
await waitFor(() => {
  expect(screen.getByText(/Expected Text/)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### 4. **Keyboard Input Testing**
```typescript
fireEvent.keyDown(window, { key: 'ArrowUp' });
```

## Current Test Results
- **Total Test Files**: 8
- **Total Tests**: 213
- **Passing Tests**: 97
- **Failing Tests**: 116 (mostly due to implementation details and timing issues)

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **Canvas Rendering Tests**: Testing actual drawing operations is limited to verifying that canvas methods were called
2. **Animation Timing**: Some tests may be flaky due to animation timing
3. **Audio Context**: Some games may require additional audio node mocks
4. **Game State**: Complex game states (like collision detection) are difficult to test in isolation

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Integration Tests**: Add tests that play through complete game scenarios
2. **Visual Regression Testing**: Consider adding screenshot tests for games
3. **Performance Benchmarks**: Add tests for frame rate and rendering performance
4. **Accessibility Tests**: Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader support
5. **Mock Refinement**: Continue improving mocks as new game features are added

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining test failures by adjusting timing and mock expectations
2. Add more edge case tests for game boundaries
3. Implement visual regression testing for canvas-based games
4. Add performance benchmarks for game loops
5. Create e2e tests for full user journeys
